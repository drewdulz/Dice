# Dice
A dice simulator app for the Pebble smartwatch. Simply shake wrist to roll the dice.

## Why?
This was a learning project for me. I wanted to be one of the first people to create an app for the Pebble watch. Pebble is an exciting piece of technology and I am proud to work with a platform built by a former Systems Design Engineering student from the University of Waterloo!
I'm proud to say that this app launched along side the Pebble app store, and was one of the first 1000 apps avaliable on the Pebble watch. Today, it is actively being used by over <b>1800 pebblers!</b>
While building this app I was able to gain some experience with C programming.

##Design:
I'm very happy with the simplicity of the design. There is no configuration necessary and no clicking or tapping required to start rolling dice. users simply launch the app, and shake their wrist to roll. There is also the option to press a button to roll as well if they prefer.
Special thanks to Danny Aguizi for designing the logo and app store assets.

## Technology:
Dice was coded in C using the pebble watch API.
